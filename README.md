# Olist Power BI Dashboard with Python Data Cleaning and Sentiment Analysis

Description: This repository contains the code and documentation for a Power BI dashboard based on the data provided by Olist on Kaggle. Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small businesses to marketplaces. The dataset includes information on orders, products, customers, sellers, reviews, and payments.

In addition to the Power BI dashboard, this repository also includes a folder with Python scripts for data cleaning and sentiment analysis. The data cleaning script prepares the raw data for analysis by filtering, merging, and transforming the tables. The sentiment analysis script performs a work-around sentiment analysis on the review data, leveraging pre-trained models and NLP techniques.

The Power BI dashboard provides insights into various aspects of Olist's business, such as sales, profitability, customer behavior, product performance, seller performance, and review ratings. The dashboard consists of multiple pages, each with its own visualizations, filters, and drill-down capabilities.

The dashboard was designed using best practices in data visualization and user experience, with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and interactivity. The underlying data model and queries were optimized for performance and scalability, using techniques such as data shaping, data modeling, and DAX calculations.

The code in this repository includes the Power BI Desktop file (.pbix) and the Python scripts (.ipynb). The python documentation includes a source code commenting. 

This project showcases my skills in data cleaning, sentiment analysis, data analysis, data visualization, and Power BI development. It demonstrates my ability to work with large and complex datasets, to extract insights from data, and to communicate those insights effectively to stakeholders. It also highlights my attention to detail, my creativity, and my passion for data-driven solutions.
