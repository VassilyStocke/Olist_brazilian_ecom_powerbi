# Olist Power BI Dashboard

Description: This repository contains the code and documentation for a Power BI dashboard based on the data provided by Olist on Kaggle. Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small businesses to marketplaces. The dataset includes information on orders, products, customers, sellers, reviews, and payments.

The Power BI dashboard provides insights into various aspects of Olist's business, such as sales, profitability, customer behavior, product performance, seller performance, and review ratings. The dashboard consists of multiple pages, each with its own visualizations, filters, and drill-down capabilities.

The dashboard was designed using best practices in data visualization and user experience, with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and interactivity. The underlying data model and queries were optimized for performance and scalability, using techniques such as data shaping, data modeling, and DAX calculations.

The code in this repository includes the Power BI Desktop file (.pbix), the data source files (.csv), and the DAX measures (.dax). The documentation includes a user guide, a data dictionary, and a methodology overview. The repository also includes sample screenshots and videos of the dashboard in action.

This project showcases my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and Power BI development. It demonstrates my ability to work with large and complex datasets, to extract insights from data, and to communicate those insights effectively to stakeholders. It also highlights my attention to detail, my creativity, and my passion for data-driven solutions.
